      <h2>Kick Off Questions</h2>
      <div class="introduction">
        <h3>Hello, my name is Tiffany Arellano!</h3>
        <p>I am a self-taught Frontend developer currently making the transition
          into Fullstack development with Lambda School in their part-time
          curriculum. I am known to be resourceful <span class="emph">and</span>
          readily invest my time into the success of my peers by clarifying any
          questions that they may have or with any debugging that they may need.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="questionOne">
        <h3>Why would you be a good fit for the Customer Success Engineer role?</h3>
        <p>In my short experience with Lambda School, I realized that sharing
          the relief and success with my fellow Lambda School peers through
          assisting them was where the real joy was at. This doesn't mean that I
          don't enjoy my own personal projects as I enjoy these very much, but I
          feel so much more accomplished being an assistance to others.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="questionTwo">
        <h3>Why do you want to work here over somewhere else?</h3>
        <p>I was baited by the hours that is required to work. I come
          from Eastern Standard Time of United States, but my hours fit
          perfectly around the required hours of Australian east-coast business
          time.</p>
        <p>However, it was the company's mission that I was hooked by. My career
          goal as a Fullstack developer is to join a company whose culture
          aligns with my own moral-compass. I want my work to be beneficial not
          just for my wallet but meaningful in its impact. To be a Fullstack
          developer is my goal, but to contribute myself to something greater is
          my passion.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="questionThree">
        <h3>What are two things you are excited about, two things you want to
          learn, and two things you don't want to do?</h3>
        <div class="excitedAbout">
          <h4>Two things I am excited about:</h4>
          <ol>
            <li>Plan new product features based on feedback from customers.</li>
            <li>Running a training session with a customer to set up their
              unique campaign.</li>
          </ol>
        </div>

        <div class="toLearn">
          <h4>Two things I want to learn:</h4>
          <ol>
            <li>Work with developers to debug and resolve a product issue.</li>
            <li>Importing data into a new Raisely CRM account.</li>
          </ol>
        </div>

        <div class="dontWant">
          <h4>Two things I don't want to do:</h4>
          <ol>
            <li>Create engaging content for social media and digital marketing.</li>
            <li>Writing a new support article on how to optimise your donation
              form.</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="questionFour">
        <h3>Tell us about a platform you believe has solved a complex problem
          really well, and why. Would you change anything in their approach?</h3>
        <p>Everybody business owner should own a website but not everybody can
          afford the cost of a developer, but companies like Squarespace, Wix,
          and Wordpress has solved the issue of "unaffordability". Their
          user-friendly approach in allowing their members to easily create a
          website is something that I regret not learning how to do myself.</p>
        <p>However, I have assisted several people deploy their own websites and
          feel that each of the three (there are obviously more but these three
          are what I am familiar with) lack something that the other has.</p>
        <p>For example, Squarespace is by far the easiest and friendliest to use
          in terms of allowing the user to design a presentable website, but it
          lacks in that the dashboard is confusing. You have to go through
          multiple links to make a new blog post or to check Analytics.</p>
        <p>Wix and Wordpress dominates Squarespace with their dashboard but Wix
          has a terrible lag with their drag/drop build. Wordpress only allows
          advanced CSS customization but it is still restricted to the base
          code. In my opinion, Wordpress dominates Wix in terms of the vast
          amount of community support and they both equal in their support of
          SEO automation.</p>
